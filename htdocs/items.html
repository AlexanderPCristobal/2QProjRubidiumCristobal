			<h2>Items</h2>
			<p><a id="links" href="items.html">Items</a> in Undertale are used to heal, boost stats, equip stronger <a id="links" href="#weapons">weapons</a> or <a id="links" href="#armor">armor</a>. These <a id="links" href="items/html">items</a> can be either bought from the many shops in the world or be picked up from a chest or the ground. <a id="links" href="items.html">Items</a> can also be sold at any shop. They can be stored in the player's inventory or in Dimensional Boxes, which can be spotted across the map. </p>

			<h3>Consumables</h3>
			<p>Consumables are <a id="links" href="items.html">items</a> that can be used either during a battle or in the overworld. Most items restore HP, but some can give certain stat boosts and in some cases, subtract HP. Most consumables can be bought from the different shops in the world, each shop having different <a id="links" href="items.html">items</a> to be bought.</p>
