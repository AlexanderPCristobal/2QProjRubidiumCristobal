			<h3>About Undertale</h3>
			<p>Undertale is an <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">RPG (role-playing game)</a> independently developed by Toby Fox using the <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker">Game Maker: Studio</a>. Its initial release is on September 15, 2015 for <a id="links" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/">Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X</a>, later expanding to consoles such as <a id="links" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3893-CUSA08801_00-TFSHVCUTPS400084">PlayStation 4</a> and <a id="links" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/undertale/9pjggx9xjxpb">Xbox</a>. Toby Fox tried to minmize the staff as much as possible to make the game the way he envisioned it. With this, the game only had 15 staff members, including himself, which is not what one would expect for a 6 hour, story-based video game that has overwhelmingly positive reviews across the globe. Some staff members include Temmie Chang (Main Artist), Merrigo (Background Artist), and Guzusuru (Animation Assistant). Undertale is rated 4.9/5 in <a id="links" href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/undertale/user-reviews/adult">Common Sense Media</a>, 93% in <a id="links" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/undertale">Metacritic</a>, and 10/10 in <a id="links" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review">IGN</a>. After making Undertale, Toby Fox also created a similar game to Undertale called <a id="links" href="https://deltarune.com/">Deltarune</a>, which is the same world as Undertale but in a different universe.</p>

			<h3>Gameplay</h3>
			<p>The battle system of Undertale is a mix of the traditional <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">RPG games</a> (with turn-based combat) and <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Bullet_hell">bullet-hell games</a>. The player has 4 options during their turn; that is, fight, act, item, and mercy. Fighting would damage the opponent involving <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_time_event#:~:text=In%20video%20games%2C%20a%20quick,cinematic%20sequences%20in%20the%20game.">quick time event</a>. Acting would prompt several acts that could change the behavior of the opponent and ultimately the ending of a battle. Using Item would let the player use items gathered from their journey. Finally, selecting Mercy would spare the enemy if the correct actions have been used during the fight. After the player ends their turn, they control their SOUL (represented by a red heart) which should avoide attacks unleased by the opponent. These attacks would have new elements implemented as the game progresses, such as objects that require the soul to stay still or move through them. Killing an enemy will reward EXP and LV, but neither are given if the opponent is spared. Gold (used for buying items in the overworld) is rewarded when fighting or sparing. Killing enemies also leads to higher HP (health points) of the player.</p>

			<p>There are three routes in the game; namely, pacifist, genocide, and neutral. The pacifict route would mean the player spared every single monster they encountered. This is most famously known as the "good" ending. On the other hand, genocide route means that the player killed every single monster they encountered, leaving you with the "bad" ending. The neutral route is when the player killed some monsters, but spared some as well. Details can't really be explained further, as it would spoil some parts here and there, ruining the overall experience when playing the game.</p>
			<p>The overworld has several notable locations, some with simple puzzles and some with powerful bosses. In the pacifist and neutral routes, these puzzles need to be solved in order for the player to progress. Grinding and backtracking aren't needed and there are almost no side quests in the game, unlike the traditional <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">RPG games</a>. If the player decides to do the genocide route, most of the puzzles are disabled and the player has to grind in order to progress. Choosing the genocide route would basically lead to the usual <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">RPG game</a>, but it would greatly affect the world around you, making every single action held accountable by you in the end.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the game is the <a id="links" href="htdocs/characters.html">characters</a>. The game is known for its witty and fun dialogue depending on the player's action. What's really eye-catching in these dialogues is the fact that some major <a id="links" href="htdocs/characters.html">characters</a> have <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming_(role-playing_games)">meta-knowledge</a>, making the save feature, a usually normal feature in <a id="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">RPG games</a>, have a part in the <a id="links" href="#story">story</a> as some <a id="links" href="htdocs/characters.html">characters</a> remember the player's actions in previous playthroughs. This really hits the player with the message that every action, even if it's in an entirely differen playthrough, matters.</p>

			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>Long ago, two races ruled the Earth: Humans and Monsters. One day, war broke out between the two races. After a long battle, the humans were victorious. The greatest of the human magicians sealed the monsters underground with a magic spell. Many years later, on Mt. Ebott, 201X, legends say that those who climb the mountain never return. A human child ventures off to this mountain, and finds a large hole in the mountain and accidentally falls in. After falling in, the human is greeted by a sentient flower by the name of Flowey, who seems to be friendly and teaches the human concepts such as EXP and LV. When Flowey attempts to kill the human and take his soul, a goat-like monster named Toriel rescues the human. The human is taught about puzzles and the concept of mercy by Toriel. From there, the human seeks to search for the king of the underground's castle, where the barrier that separates the human and monster worlds resides. Along the human's journey, he meets several monsters that intend to help or kill the human. Once the human reaches the castle, he learns that Asgore seeks seven human souls to break the barrier, of which he has six. The ending of the game depends on the route the player chose to take.</p>
